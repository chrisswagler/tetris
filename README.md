# tetris

This program was created as a project in Fundamentals of Computer Science at Northeastern. This version of Tetris, having similarity to the original tetris, has features including:
<ul> 
  <li>Piece shifting using the left and right arrow keys</li>
  <li>Piece rotation using the "a" and "s" keys</li>
  <li>Inability for pieces to move or rotate beyond the grid boundaries</li>
  <li>Random piece generation and spawn location along the top of the grid</li>
  <li>Piece pile accumulation at the bottom of the grid when a piece falls onto the bottom or another piece</li>
  <li>Random pile debris generation specified at the start of the game</li>
  <li>Row clearing once a row is filled</li>
  <li>Point system of 10 * (number of rows cleared)^2</li>
  <li>Game completion when the pile accumulates to the top of the grid</li>
</ul>

As per the timeline specified in the course, the game was completed across three weeks, with certain checkpoints for each week:
<ul>
  <li>Piece creation, grid, piece shifting, piece rotation, spawn generation, boundary restrictions, and piece drop down at each tick</li>
  <li>Additional pieces, pile accumulation (requiring modification of world state), starting debris, and game over conditions</li>
  <li>Score (requiring modification of world state), score visbility when playing game, and function simplification from previous iterations</li>
</ul>

During the progression of the project, a partner switch was carried out by the course instructors. This resulted in both myself and my new partner to have two viable programs to work with when proceeding with the project. Both sets of code were compared for functionality and efficiency to determine the best combined program to use moving forward.
